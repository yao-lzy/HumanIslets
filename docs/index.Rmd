# General Introduction

The HumanIslets tool houses data collected from or associated with human islets procured by the University of Alberta. The data includes clinical metadata

I envision a branching timeline, so that you can visualize everything that happened to an islet sample prior to the collection of each data type. Here is a rough outline of steps (I know itâ€™s incomplete/wrong - will look at some of the guides on the IsletCore website to better sketch out)

   1. Pancreas procurement
   2. Shipping to Edmonton
   3. Islet isolation (more details here - I assume many/multiple steps)
   4. GSIS outcomes
   5. Other outcomes at UofA
   6. Shipping to other labs for seahorse, perifusion, omics
   7. Shipping to other labs (not in project)
